**Task:** CODTECH-Internship-password strength cheker


To assess the strength of passwords entered by users, we can implement a Python tool that evaluates different factors such as length, complexity (use of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters), and uniqueness. This tool will provide feedback on whether the password is weak, moderate, or strong.


mainly password cheker has some factor to check the strength of password inputed by an user.

**1. Length of the Password:**

A password with fewer than 8 characters is considered weak.
A password with between 8-12 characters is moderate.
A password with more than 12 characters is considered strong.

**2. Complexity of the Password:**

A strong password typically contains:
Uppercase letters.
Lowercase letters.
Numbers.
Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.).
If the password contains all of the above, it is considered highly complex.

**3. Uniqueness of the Password:**

The password should not match common passwords or dictionary words.
We can check the password against a list of commonly used passwords or common dictionary words.

**4. Additional Factors:**

Avoid patterns like "1234", "abcd", and repetition of the same character.
